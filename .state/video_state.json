        "content": "Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity after exhausting their nuclear fuel. Their gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, creating an event horizon. Inside, matter is crushed into an infinitely dense point called a singularity. Scientists are still unraveling the mysteries of what lies beyond this extreme region."
